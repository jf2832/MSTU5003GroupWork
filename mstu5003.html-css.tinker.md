# Tinker Problem: Meow Mix

---


### HTML things

**How does _SEQUENCE_ affect the visual display of HTML elements?**

HTML works in a top-down sequence. Visual items appear on the page from top to bottom as noted by the html elements. For example, the position of a paragraph in the Meow Mix example is based on how it is ordered in the code. If we move an `<h3>` below a `<p>`, the `<p>` will display before the `<h3>`.


**What are some ways that the _hierarchy_ of your tags will affect the end result / visual output?**

It will affect the order of display and also the CSS.The color of the text on a website can also be affected by the hierarchy of tags in its script. For example, a class declaration that renders blue text can be overridden by a subsequent class declaration in some cases. The hierarchy of tags is important for both visual output and functionality. For example, when looking at the table element, if tags are moved around, elements end up in different cells (or you end up creating cells where they aren’t meant to be). Div class attributes meant for a set of elements, may be associated with other elements if tags are not nested properly. Also you must close a tag in the proper hierarchy (ex. ```<p><a></a></p>```) you cannot do (ex. ```<p><a></p></a>```)


**Add/remove/manipulate various elements, ids, classes, attributes. What did you do and what did you discover in terms of the GENERALIZABLE patterns?**

The elimination of elements completely removes sections of a website. Removing `ids` prevents CSS from stylizing HTML elements. Changing attributes can be done quickly. For example, a border-radius can be made sharper or rounder by increasing or descreasing values. `Ids` and `classes` only affect the visual output if CSS is applied to it. You can add/remove/manipulate `ids` and `classes` without a visual affect as long as CSS is not involved. If you add/remove/manipulate most `elements`, the output is changed.

`Ids` typically help to style `elements`; however if there are no `id` declarations in the CSS, changing them doesn’t really do anything. For example I switched the `id` of several elements; however, there were no `id` declarations, so nothing happened. There were several different classes in this snippet of code. Changing the `classes` drastically changed the appearance of the website because giving an `element` a different `class` provided that element with different attributes. For example, by changing the body ```<div class="container">``` to ```<div class=”container-top”>```, the entire website ended up having a gray background. `Classes` can also contain styling attributes that affect the position of `elements` on the page. From code camp we learned that ids override classes; however, once again because there were no associated id declarations in the CSS, the elements took on the attributes of the class style. Now, by adding an id declaration in the CSS (ex. ```#intro {color: orange;}```), it ended up making the first three paragraphs including the title orange.



**Try to add an embedded Youtube video in the section#videos tag. Before you do, take a guess as to what you expect to see as the visual result. Were your guesses correct?**

Sherry expected to see an unfurled video and she did. Jen's guess was that if she added an embedded youtube video into the section #videos tag, it would take up a lot of room and would go from left edge to right edge because there would be no #videos declaration in the CSS that controls the appearance of the video. After inserting the video she noticed that it was not contained within the gray border because she realized that it was its own section and was not within the ```<div class="container-main">``` After moving the closing div tag to below the #video section, the video was then contained within the gray border. However, she also noticed that the video is a fixed size due to the inline style properties that comes with the youtube video embed code. Therefore, anytime she made her browser window smaller, the youtube video would still stay the same size and would expand beyond the gray border. Therefore, she adjusted the width of the inline embed code to 100% which helped solve this issue. The video width now adjusts with the size of the browser window. Paul's first effort resulted in the creation of a video link.  He expected the code to render a window for the video.


**Create some notes as _comments_ in this code. What are some ways that you can use comments to help you understand your code better?**

Comments can help you keep in mind what you are trying to accomplish at each step of the coding process. Commenting on each section of the code can also help you remember how each piece of code contributes to your website. Comments can also force you to think out the specifics of what you are doing and why. They are also helpful when your code becomes long. Comments can be used to help give headings to different sections of the webpage or they can even provide a brief description of how that specific section is styled. For example ```<!-- MAIN BODY - RED FONT, GRAY BACKGROUND -->``` 

**Take a look at the following: What is the generalizable syntax **_pattern_** between all these tags?**

A series of components follow a linear flow. Each component (element) has a beginning and ending (the tags).Also, all of the start tags need to open and close. Additionally, the generalizable syntax pattern is always the tag followed by the attribute, equal sign, open quote, text, close quote. You can always have multiple attributes within a tag.


**Take a look at the following cheetsheets: [HTML5 Cheatsheet] Muck around with the page and try to add a new content feature using some _new_ elements you haven't directly worked with in FCC. How did you go about learning how to utilize a new element (process)?**

The process can be intuitive. The h tags create headings and the p tags create paragraphs, which means that the code isn't completely foreign to basic intuition. Paul related the code to the syntax of a spoken language. He loves learning languages, so he also enjoyed learning code. Sherry started with just the element, then added the type and a maxlength. She just played around with it. Adding one thing at a time and running the code to see if it did what she thought it would. Jen plugged different elements in and just experimented to see what it did. She thought about what I would want to accomplish visually and looked for elements that would help her achieve the visual effect that she wanted.

**How can different `elements`, `classes`, and `id`s help to _organize_ our html content?**

Each element is a building block for a website. The elements you use determine what your website looks like and does. The order of the elements and classes helps determine the visual flow of the website.

If each element is labeled correctly, that is if a paragraph is lable p and a 2nd level header is labled h2 we can quickly format all of the same items in the same way giving them a uniform look that helps users understand the organization.

Additionally, identifiers are important because they help connect the CSS to the html. They help us identify and organize chunks or types of text that we would want to style or refer to. They help simplify the code rather than requiring us to use inline styles for each section.

### CSS things
**Take a look at the following _almanac_ of CSS selectors and properties: [30 CSS Selectors], [CSS Tricks Almanac] and use some new selectors and css properties to change the visual look of the page. Why do we have so many different kinds of CSS selectors available?**

People want the freedom and flexibility to create a website that fits their imaginations. Many selectors need to be available for maximum control in creating the right look and style.

**Take a look at the following: What is the generalizable syntax **_pattern_** between all these css rules?**

Generally, the div tag is a common part of CSS. Additionally, the following pattern is present: target item, open bracket, css property, colon, value, semicolon, closing bracket.

**Probably, no programmer knows every CSS rule and/or property by memory. I certainly don't, but I know a lot. How then, should you go about studying resources like [30 CSS Selectors] and [CSS Tricks Almanac] to help you become a more capable and efficient programmer?** 

We just have to code. We need to try to build and use the guides along the way. To do so efficiently, we need to understand how to use the resources so that unknown information can be quickly retrieved. While building, we should look for groups of rules and/or patterns across rules.

### COMBINED and META things

**How might HTML sequence and hierarchy of tags affect your CSS rules?**

The hierarchy of the HTML tags does not have a critical impact on CSS rules because CSS selectors can be applied to html tags anywhere in a script. However, HTML sequence and hierarchy may affect the inheritence of CSS rules. If CSS tags themselves are inverted, that can create situations where commands are overridden. 

**Based on your understanding of how _sequence, hierarchy, syntax_ affects the page; What do you think are best practices to systematically fix errors in your code?**

Go step-by-step. It is essential to test code after adding each new component. This way, you can catch bugs at each step of the coding process. If there is something wrong, test one thing at a time. First try fixing the HTML then try fixing the CSS. Always double check syntax because that is most likely the problem. It is also a good idea to include comments in each section of code. Systematically commenting out sections of code can help to determine where the problem is.
 
**Based on said understanding, what are some best practices to reduce errors _as you code?_**

Use comments to help organize your code. Don’t try to code too much at a time. Periodically run the page to make sure it's doing what is expected and that everything looks ok before adding another piece of code to the text. Double check brackets! Another way to fix code is to isolate the code in a new script for experimentation. Code can be tested and corrected more quickly and simply when it is not displayed amid many tags and elements.


**What is the _STRENGTH_ of FCC exercises and what is the _LIMITATION_ with respect to learning and understanding?**

A strength of FCC is that it presents clear and concise lessons. The bite size chunks and learn-by-doing are helpful. It literally leads you step by step through the process and it's a great place to start to learn how to code. A limitation of FCC is that it doesn't provide many extra examples, there is a lack of collaboration,  and it was basically a monkey see monkey do, but there was no further explanation. 

**What is the _STRENGTH_ of tinkering and what is the _LIMITATION_ with respect to your learning and understanding?**

A strength of tinkering is that it allows you to learn through experimentation, which can deepen your understanding; you get the opportunity to play around with code and see what happens when you alter things. It’s a fun exercise and it helps us practice how to _read_ code. It engages learn-by-doing and it encourages an attitude of accepting errors as part of the learning/design process. However, tinkering can also waste time when it does not seem to lead to any new insights. In such cases, an instructor is more useful. Without guidance and feedback, it can lead down an unproductive path.


**What kinds of things did your group members learn, notice, experience that you did not and **why** do you think that is with respect to **HOW** you each respectively studied the materials?**

We realized that we had similar answers to the questions, even though we did not work on the questions together at first.  We must have had similar experiences as we experimented with the code.  We did have similar educational experiences in coding, which is probably why.  We have all taken coding classes.
